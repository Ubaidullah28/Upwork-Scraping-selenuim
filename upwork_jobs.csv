Project Context: We’re building a module for a web/mobile application that calculates renovation budgets and instantly recommends material purchases from partner suppliers. Right now, we have several real examples of estimate files in different formats (PDFs and scans). Your task is to help us test the best OCR/CV approach (Tesseract, Google Cloud Vision, Azure Form Recognizer, Amazon Textract, or similar) to find a cost-effective and robust solution. Scope of Work: Analyze input files: Understand the structure, file quality, and potential edge cases. Set up OCR extraction: Configure Tesseract and/or other commercial OCR APIs to test parsing quality. Build a prototype pipeline: File upload → OCR → table parsing → export to JSON or CSV. Test and validate: Run the pipeline on at least 5–10 real estimate files, identify limitations, and measure accuracy. Provide recommendations: Suggest how to improve quality (image pre-processing, custom training, post-processing). Deliverables: A working prototype (script or simple web tool) that takes a sample file and outputs structured . Clear setup instructions for testing the pipeline. Short report with results: parsing quality, accuracy issues, what works/what doesn’t. Suggestions for further development (e.g., which API or model is best suited for production). Tech Requirements & Constraints: Python preferred (pytesseract, Camelot, Tabula, etc.), but Node.js or other tech is acceptable if justified. If proposing a commercial OCR API, please provide estimated costs and usage limits. The final solution must be delivered with clear, well-documented source code. Timeline: Ready to start immediately. Target for a first working prototype and results: 5–10 working days. What We Expect from You: Proven experience with OCR/Computer Vision and document/table parsing. Examples of similar projects (invoices, forms, construction docs, etc.). Ability to explain different options (open-source vs commercial API). Good communication skills and clear documentation of your work. What We’ll Provide: 5–10 real estimate files for testing. Expected structure and output format. Basic API info for connecting to our partner’s pricing database (if needed for test). What to Include in Your Proposal: Briefly describe your relevant experience and which tools you recommend for this task. Share how you would approach building the prototype. Attach or link any past work that shows you’ve done similar parsing/OCR tasks. Bonus: If the prototype works well, we’re open to discussing a longer-term contract for developing a custom model or full integration with our backend.",2025-07-15 15:22:59

We’re looking to hire someone who can help us create our own GPT model trained on our content and tuned to suit the unique needs of our business and customers. We’ve got a treasure trove of over 2,000 flyfishing articles (PDFs, blog posts, print magazines, etc.) and want to build a GPT that truly understands flyfishing in an Australian and NZ context. The standard AI tools out there just don’t cut it – they lean too heavily on American content and miss the mark when it comes to how Aussies speak, think, and fish. What we need: A custom GPT model trained on our flyfishing content Set up to only recommend products we stock (we run on Shopify) Ability to prioritise our existing content and ignore US-based answers that aren’t relevant to our customers Aussie/NZ tone – casual, informative, and fun (no stiff corporate voice) Future-proof setup so it can be used: As an in-store AI assistant (voice activated) As a website chatbot that helps sell gear and answer customer questions Integration with our Shopify product to only reference in-stock items You’ll ideally have experience with: GPT fine-tuning and embedding custom datasets Setting up custom AI tools with OpenAI or similar APIs Shopify integration (especially product availability syncing) Natural language training/customisation – Aussie tone is essential Knowledge of flyfishing is a bonus, but not essential (we’ve got the content for that) Deliverables: A working MVP GPT that can answer technical flyfishing questions Uses only our provided articles as its knowledge base Recommends only available products from our Shopify inventory Deployed as a web chatbot (with plans for in-store voice assistant to follow) What success looks like: When someone asks about choosing a leader for chasing trout on the Goulburn River, the GPT gives an expert answer that sounds like a seasoned Aussie flyfisher – and it recommends Frog Hair, the brand we recommend in-store, not whatever’s trending on US websites. Keen to work with someone who can: Help guide the tech setup Communicate clearly with someone that is tech savvy but not an AI expert. Deliver clean, future-ready results If this sounds like a project you’d enjoy, we’d love to hear from you. Flick us a message with a quick rundown of relevant experience and any questions you’ve got.
