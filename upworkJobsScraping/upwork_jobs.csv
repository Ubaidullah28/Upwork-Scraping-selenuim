We’ll evaluate the feasibility of integration. Objective 2: Recognize various common materials (using existing online models). How: Through an on-site device + camera (No Cloud). Objective 3: Recognize special materials. How: Through an on-site device + camera (No Cloud). Key Requirements • Proven experience in object detection and image classification projects. • Strong skills in , annotation, and visual dataset management. • Ability to support a technical team in architectural decision-making. • Practical, solution-oriented approach with a focus on scalability. If you’ve worked on computer vision, edge computing, and image recognition projects, you might be the right fit. Type of collaboration: Freelance / ongoing consultancy Work mode: Remote + occasional on-site meetings (Brescia, Iseo, and Castegnato) Send us a short description of your background and, if available, a portfolio or relevant project.",2025-07-12 17:47:36
